<p> The approach followed in IAQ model ontology is actually in line with the scope of the project towards extending the core BIM ontology with additional models that are of interest for specific business stakeholders. A non-exhaustive list of entities is incorporated in the model, focusing on key concepts that are of interest in the project. We have to point out that the work is not delivered from scratch; as concepts defined in <a href="https://w3c-lbd-cg.github.io/bot/">BOT</a> and <a href="http://vocab.linkeddata.es/datosabiertos/def/medio-ambiente/calidad-aire/index-en.html">calidad-aire</a> are inherited in the model.</p>
